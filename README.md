High-performance, multi-client Linux driver for the Elgato 4K60 Pro MK.2 and Elgato 4K Pro PCI-e capture cards. Engineered for stability on modern kernels (6.12 through 7.0+).

*For older kernels, use the original [stoth68000/sc0710](https://github.com/stoth68000/sc0710) repository (MK.2 only).*

## Supported cards

| Card | Subsystem ID | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Elgato 4K60 Pro MK.2** | `1cfa:000e` | Plug-and-play after driver load. No FPGA firmware step. |
| **Elgato 4K Pro** | `1cfa:0012` | Requires **ECP5 FPGA firmware** programming on every **cold boot**. Handled automatically by the installer and the AUR package; manual `insmod` builds need extra steps (see below). |

Both cards share the same `12ab:0710` Magewell chipset but use different board profiles in the driver.

## Kernel compatibility

| Distribution | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Arch Linux** | Stable | DKMS via AUR (`sc0710-dkms-git`) or manual build. Includes `sc0710-cli` and 4K Pro firmware helpers (see below). |
| **Fedora / RHEL** | Stable | DKMS via the automatic installer. |
| **Debian / Ubuntu** | Stable | **Warning:** distro OBS packages may crash; prefer Flatpak OBS. |
| **Fedora Atomic** (Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, Silverblue) | Stable | Boot-time build service at `/var/lib/sc0710`. No DKMS. 4K Pro ECP5 stack included. |
| **NixOS** | Supported | Flake module builds the driver and installs `sc0710-cli`; 4K Pro firmware is a one-time `extract-firmware.sh` run (see below). |

Tested on kernel **6.12 through 7.0+**. Newer kernels may work but are not guaranteed until tested.

## Installation

### Automatic installation (recommended)

Unified installer — auto-detects atomic vs standard distros. Supported on Arch, Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, and Fedora Atomic (Bazzite, Silverblue, Bluefin, Aurora).

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nakildias/sc0710/main/scripts/install-sc0710.sh)"
```

**Standard distros** get DKMS (optional) or a manual module build, `sc0710-cli`, and boot-time module loading via `modules-load.d`.

**Atomic distros** get:
- Driver source at `/var/lib/sc0710/` (persists across `rpm-ostree` updates)
- `sc0710-build.service` — rebuilds and loads the module on each boot
- `sc0710-cli` with atomic-specific commands (`--rebuild`, etc.)

**4K Pro on any distro** additionally gets extraction of `SC0710.FWI.HEX` from the Elgato Windows driver at install time (`extract-firmware.sh`, with pinned checksums). Downloading from Elgato always asks for consent first, so a non-interactive install extracts only if the Elgato package is already on disk — otherwise re-run the script in a terminal afterwards.

### 4K Pro ECP5 firmware (cold boot)

The 4K Pro has a Lattice ECP5 FPGA whose configuration is **volatile** — it is lost on full power-off / cold boot. Windows programs it on every boot; this driver programs it during its probe, and **fails the probe if it can't** (missing firmware file, upload failure) — the card then stays unbound and no `/dev/video*` appears, with the reason in `dmesg`.

**If the card didn't bind:**

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep sc0710              # shows why the probe failed
sudo bash scripts/extract-firmware.sh # if the firmware file is missing
sudo sc0710-cli --restart
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S sc0710-dkms-git
```

The AUR package installs:

- **DKMS kernel module** — rebuilds automatically on kernel updates
- **`sc0710-cli`** at `/usr/bin/sc0710-cli` — same management tool as the automatic installer
- **4K Pro firmware helpers** under `/usr/lib/sc0710/` (`extract-firmware.sh`, `sc0710-firmware-lib.sh`)

**MK.2 users** can load with `sudo modprobe sc0710` (or enable `/etc/modules-load.d/sc0710.conf` for boot load) and manage the driver with `sc0710-cli`.

**4K Pro users** — if a 4K Pro card (`1cfa:0012`) is present at install/upgrade time, the package hook:

1. Extracts `SC0710.FWI.HEX` if the Elgato installer is already on disk (`p7zip` needed; the hook never downloads — pacman runs it non-interactively, and downloading from Elgato requires a consent prompt). If firmware ends up missing, run `sudo bash /usr/lib/sc0710/extract-firmware.sh` in a terminal afterwards.
2. Configures boot module loading via `modules-load.d` and `modprobe.d` softdeps
3. Loads the driver (which programs the ECP5 during its probe)

After a **cold boot**, the driver programs the ECP5 when the module loads — no services involved. If the card didn't bind (no `/dev/video*`):

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep sc0710
sudo sc0710-cli --restart
```

If the card was added **after** the AUR install, extract the firmware manually:

```bash
sudo /usr/lib/sc0710/extract-firmware.sh
sudo sc0710-cli --restart
```

**Removing the AUR package** — firmware files under `/lib/firmware/sc0710/` are not removed by `yay -R`; use `sc0710-cli --remove` for a full cleanup.

**Upgrading from an older package version** — old versions created `sc0710-firmware.service`/`sc0710-firmware-verify.service` outside the package (the driver programs the ECP5 itself now, so they no longer exist). The package upgrade removes those leftovers automatically; the [removal check script](#verify-complete-removal) flags any stragglers.

**4K Pro on Arch** — the maintainer primarily tests on MK.2 hardware. Cold-boot ECP5 reports from 4K Pro users are especially welcome ([open an issue](https://github.com/Nakildias/sc0710/issues) with `sc0710-cli --dump`).

### NixOS (flakes)

Add `github:Nakildias/sc0710` as a flake input and import `sc0710.nixosModules.default`:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ...
    sc0710.url = "github:Nakildias/sc0710";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, sc0710 }: {
    nixosConfigurations.<your-hostname> = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        # ...
        sc0710.nixosModules.default
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Host configuration:

```nix
hardware.sc0710.enable = true;          # kernel module + sc0710-cli
# hardware.sc0710.kernel = pkgs.linuxPackages_6_19.kernel;  # optional override
```

**Note:** The NixOS module builds the driver and installs `sc0710-cli`. **4K Pro users on NixOS** additionally run `scripts/extract-firmware.sh` once (as root, from a repo checkout) to provision the ECP5 firmware and EDID profiles — it installs to `/lib/firmware/sc0710`, which the kernel firmware loader reads directly. (MK.2 users don't need it: capture works without firmware files, and custom EDIDs are written at runtime — no firmware install required.) The driver programs the FPGA at every module load and refuses to bind if it can't, so no boot service is needed.

### Manual compilation

For development or unsupported distros.

1. **Install dependencies**
   - **Arch:** `sudo pacman -S base-devel linux-headers git`
   - **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) git`
   - **Fedora/RHEL:** `sudo dnf install kernel-modules-$(uname -r) kernel-devel kernel-headers gcc make git`

2. **Build and load**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nakildias/sc0710
   cd sc0710
   make
   sudo insmod build/sc0710.ko
   ```

3. **4K Pro only** — `insmod` alone is not enough on cold boot. You also need:
   - `SC0710.FWI.HEX` in `/lib/firmware/sc0710/` (extract with `scripts/extract-firmware.sh`)
   - Reload the module after cold boot so the driver can program the ECP5, or use the automatic installer

## Driver management (`sc0710-cli`)

Installed by the automatic installer, the AUR package, and the NixOS module. Provides real-time control on both atomic and standard distros.

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `--status` | `-s` | Module state, card info, signal format, ECP5 status (4K Pro), DKMS or build service status |
| `--load` | `-l` | Load the module. On 4K Pro, verifies ECP5 programming after load |
| `--unload` | `-u` | Unload the module (stops PipeWire consumers if the module is busy) |
| `--restart` | | Full reload. On 4K Pro, runs ECP5 programming with retries |
| `--debug` | `-d` | Toggle verbose `dmesg` logging |
| `--image-toggle` | `-it` | Toggle No Signal images vs colorbars |
| `--procedural-timings` | `-pt` | Cycle timing mode: merge → procedural-only → static-only |
| `--keep-audio-alive` | `-kaa` | Toggle always-on audio capture (off by default). See below |
| `--update` | `-U` | Pull latest source, rebuild, reload. On 4K Pro, re-runs ECP5 programming with retries |
| `--rebuild` | | *(Atomic only)* Force rebuild the module for the running kernel |
| `--dump` | | Save a debug report to the Desktop (`dump-DD-MM-YYYY.txt`) for GitHub issues |
| `--remove` | `-r`, `-R` | Uninstall driver, CLI, services, config files, and 4K Pro firmware |
| `--version` | `-v` | Show installed driver version |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show all options |

After `sc0710-cli --remove`, verify everything is gone:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nakildias/sc0710/main/scripts/check-sc0710-removal.sh)"
```

### Verify complete removal

Same command as above — checks module, DKMS, CLI, systemd units, config files, logs, and 4K Pro firmware. No clone or sudo required. Exits `0` when fully clean.

## Features

* **Multi-client support** — multiple apps (e.g. OBS + Discord) can open the device simultaneously
* **DKMS integration** — automatic rebuilds on kernel updates (standard distros)
* **Atomic / immutable support** — boot-time rebuild via `sc0710-build.service` (Bazzite, Silverblue, etc.)
* **4K Pro ECP5 auto-programming** — firmware extraction at install time; the driver programs the FPGA at load and refuses to bind if it can't
* **Status images** — storage-efficient No Signal / No Device screens
* **Connection sensing** — distinguishes unplugged cables from signal loss (not 100% reliable)
* **Video formats** — 4K60, 1440p144, 1080p240. **EDID Source control (Internal/Display/Merged) on both cards** via the `EDID Source` V4L2 control (`v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl=edid_source=N`). **Custom EDID read/write on both cards** via `VIDIOC_G_EDID`/`VIDIOC_S_EDID` — the 4K Pro through its EEPROM (`edid=` boot param, profiles from `scripts/extract-firmware.sh`), the MK.2 through its MCU (runtime only). The graphical **EDID Config app** (`sc0710-cli --edid-config`) manages this for both cards and can fetch Elgato's official EDID profiles
* **Mode-switch stability** — DMA resync, restart validation, and watchdog recovery during resolution/refresh changes; apps are told to renegotiate via `V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE`
* **Timing controls** — runtime modes (`merge`, `procedural-only`, `static-only`) via CLI
* **HDR (MK.2)** — host PQ→SDR tonemap on **YUYV and BGR24**, MCU **hardware tonemap** via `hw_tonemap` / MCU `0x11`, or native BGR24 HDR passthrough with BT.2020/PQ tags
* **Driver manager GUI** — `sc0710-cli --gui` (load/unload/restart, toggles, EDID/HDR config launchers, dump + HDR tests)
* **Debug dumps** — `sc0710-cli --dump` collects distro, kernel, `lspci`, driver version, and service state for issue reports

### Pixel formats (YUYV 4:2:2 and native BGR24 4:4:4)

Two capture formats are offered; pick per app over V4L2, no reload:

* **`YUYV` (default)** — packed 4:2:2, 2 bytes/pixel. Lowest bandwidth, always available.
* **`BGR24`** — native **4:4:4**, 3 bytes/pixel: the card's full-chroma mode (Elgato markets
  it "RGB24 8-bit 4:4:4"; the bytes are BGR-ordered). ~50 % more PCIe/RAM bandwidth than
  YUYV, so it is opt-in. Reported as **full-range sRGB** for SDR, or **BT.2020 / PQ** when
  HDMI is HDR and host tonemap is off.

```bash
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --list-formats                     # YUYV + BGR3
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-fmt-video=pixelformat=BGR3   # select 4:4:4
# OBS / ffmpeg pick it via the normal format menu / -pixel_format bgr24
```

On **MK.2**, HDR mode can also auto-select the format while idle:

* **`sw_tonemap=1` (default)** + HDMI HDR-PQ → host PQ→SDR preview: **BGR24** luminance-preserving RGB (preferred); **YUYV** limited-range Y LUT + mild chroma pull. SDR tags.
* **`sw_tonemap=0`** + **`hdr_bgr24=1` (default)** + HDMI HDR → prefer **BGR24**, BT.2020/PQ tags (no P010)
* SDR → leave format alone / YUYV default; no tonemap

Use `sc0710-cli --gui` for the manager, `--hdr-config` (`-hc`) for tonemap presets, or `--hdr-toggle` to cycle modes.

The format is device-wide (one card, one DMA pipeline) and can only be changed while no app
is capturing or holding buffers (a change attempt then returns `EBUSY`). Interlaced sources
are YUYV-only: a `BGR24` request is clamped to YUYV, and if a signal turns interlaced
mid-session under `BGR24` the driver delivers no frames until the format or signal changes.
For **bit-accurate** RGB capture, also present an RGB-only EDID (below): on a YCbCr wire the
card round-trips RGB→YCbCr→RGB and loses ~2 codes; on an RGB wire it captures within ±1 of
bit-perfect.

### Always-on audio capture

By default the card's audio DMA starts and stops with video streaming: the ALSA capture
device only produces samples while something is capturing video from `/dev/videoN`. That is
fine for a normal OBS setup, but it breaks always-on uses — routing the HDMI audio through
a hardware mixer, or monitoring it without a video client running.

`keep_audio_alive=1` decouples the two. An ALSA client then holds the audio session open on
its own, so the input stays live with no video capture in progress. Video is unaffected
either way.

```bash
sc0710-cli --keep-audio-alive     # or -kaa; toggles and persists to modprobe.d
```

It can also be set directly, or at load time:

```bash
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/sc0710/parameters/keep_audio_alive
# or:  modprobe sc0710 keep_audio_alive=1
```

The value is read when an audio client starts the PCM, so a change applies the next time
something opens the capture device — not to a stream already running. `/proc/sc0710-state`
reports the current hold under `aud users`. Off by default, since holding the DMA session
open keeps the card's pipeline running when nothing is capturing.

### Choosing the presented EDID

The card presents an EDID to the HDMI source; changing it changes what the source outputs
(resolution, and RGB vs YCbCr). Two ways:

* **`edid=<name>` module param** — loads `/lib/firmware/sc0710/edid/<name>.bin` at module
  load (profiles installed by `extract-firmware.sh`), e.g. `edid=1440p`.
* **`VIDIOC_S_EDID` at runtime** — `v4l2-ctl --set-edid`. For a **raw binary** EDID file add
  `,format=raw`; the default expects the hex-text format that `--get-edid` produces:

```bash
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --get-edid                          # dump current (hex text)
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-edid=file=my-edid.bin,format=raw   # write a raw .bin
```

An RGB-only EDID (color-encoding bits `00`, no YCbCr flags) makes the source output RGB
4:4:4 — the wire to pair with `BGR24` for bit-accurate 4:4:4 capture. The source
renegotiates ~8–10 s after a write (a brief re-detect of the old mode first is normal).

### Low-latency capture

* **Interrupt-driven completion (`irq_service=1`, default)** — the card's MSI wakes
  the DMA service when a frame completes, replacing the 2 ms completion polling;
  completion latency drops to interrupt latency and the idle polling load goes away.
  Polling survives as a 100 ms watchdog tick: completed work the watchdog finds that
  no interrupt announced is logged and counted (`irq:` line in `/proc/sc0710-state`),
  and three consecutive misses drop the session back to 2 ms polling with a KERN_ERR
  in dmesg. `irq_service=0` restores classic polling; failed MSI allocation logs a
  warning and falls back to polling. (`thread_dma_poll_interval_ms` remains as an
  override for the service tick; the default auto-selects.)
* **`zero_copy=1` (experimental)** — DMA frames straight into the capturing app's buffers, skipping
  the per-frame copy (~1.5–3 ms at 4K). **Strict single-client mode**: one streaming
  app per video node (a second gets `EBUSY`). Load-time only. The DMA descriptor fetcher is credit-gated in this mode —
  early hardware testing caught it consuming stale (pre-rewrite) descriptors and
  writing into already-delivered buffers; with credits a chain is only fetchable after
  its rewrites, and a permanent writeback sentinel trips loudly (and falls back to the
  copy path) if a stale fetch ever happens anyway. Validated on hardware: a userspace
  mutation checker (checksumming app-owned buffers) runs clean, with zero sentinel
  events across long captures. For full engagement keep more buffers queued than the
  DMA ring has chains (5+, e.g. `--stream-mmap=8`; most players do) — a thin queue
  routes starved laps through the copy path (`zc frames:` in `/proc/sc0710-state`
  shows the direct/copied split). Buffers can be exported as dmabufs
  (`VIDIOC_EXPBUF`) for GPU-direct consumers. `zero_copy=0` (the default) keeps the
  vendor's free-running ring, byte-identical.

**Zero-copy buffer eligibility:** a frame is DMA'd directly into a buffer when the
buffer's DMA segments fit the chain's descriptor budget (`zc_split=`, default 8, max
32); the frame is tiled across the buffer's own segments, so fragmentation within the
budget is fine. Buffers over the 32-segment hard limit are refused at QBUF with a
`zero-copy: buffer memory too fragmented` dmesg line; buffers between the budget and
the limit are accepted but served through the copy path (visible in the `zc frames:`
split — raise `zc_split=` to widen the budget). If buffers are too fragmented, fixes,
best first:

```bash
# Give ONLY the capture card a translating IOMMU domain (runtime, reversible,
# no reboot; resets to the boot default on reboot). VFIO passthrough and every
# other host device are unaffected.
G=$(basename $(readlink /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/iommu_group))
echo <BDF> | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/driver/unbind
echo DMA-FQ | sudo tee /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/$G/type
echo <BDF> | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers_probe
# or: defragment and retry
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory'
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to try |
|---------|-------------|
| **4K Pro: card didn't bind / no `/dev/video*`** (cold boot) | `sudo dmesg \| grep sc0710` for the probe error; if firmware is missing run `extract-firmware.sh`, then `sudo sc0710-cli --restart` |
| **Module won't unload** (app in use) | `sc0710-cli --unload` stops PipeWire first; close OBS/etc. |
| **Atomic: module not built after kernel update** | `sudo sc0710-cli --rebuild` or check `journalctl -u sc0710-build.service -b` |
| **Driver still present after `--remove`** | Run `sudo sc0710-cli --remove` again, then the [removal check script](#verify-complete-removal) |
| **4K60 tearing / frame shifts** at max bandwidth | Under investigation; try lower resolution/refresh or close extra consumers in the meantime |

For GitHub issues, attach output from `sc0710-cli --dump`.

## Known limitations / roadmap

* **4K60 DMA tearing** — horizontal tears or frame shifts at 4K60 (~995 MB/s) under heavy load; **under active investigation**
* **10-bit planar formats** — P010/P016 not implemented; HDR passthrough uses native **BGR24** 4:4:4 instead

## Help wanted

Maintainer **[Nakildias](https://github.com/Nakildias)** only has an **Elgato 4K60 Pro MK.2** available for hands-on testing. That limits how much can be validated on other hardware.

Contributions and testing help are especially welcome for:

* **Elgato 4K Pro** — ECP5 cold-boot behavior, atomic/Bazzite installs, and general capture stability
* **Unsupported cards** — other `12ab:0710` subsystem IDs (e.g. HD60 Pro) that are not yet fully supported
* **Open issues** — bugs that need reproduction on hardware the maintainer does not own (4K60 tearing, edge-case distros, etc.)

If you can test, debug, or submit patches for any of the above, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Nakildias/sc0710/issues) or a pull request. Include `sc0710-cli --dump` output when reporting problems.
